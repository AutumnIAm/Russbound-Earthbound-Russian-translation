+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

This FAQ is a transcribed game script of the major quotes from Earthbound for
the Super Nintendo, the English version of the RPG Mother 2 in Japan. Every
word of it was hand-typed by me. The intended purpose is to serve as a
reference to dialogue from any point in the game quickly and easily.

This is NOT a FAQ to help answer gameplay questions. There are plenty of other
FAQs that do that really well. This FAQ will contain spoilers, obviously, so
be forewarned.

For simplicity purposes, all the main characters will be referred to as their
official names: Ness, Paula, Jeff, Poo, as well as King the dog. Favorite food,
however, will simply be replaced with "(favorite food)." The part of the game
that deals with the player's name will simply become "(player)." I have used
apostrophes to replace the dots that precede every message in the game.

For those a little unfamiliar with the game, Ness is a silent protagonist. He
has almost no dialogue, and most of the speech in the game is of people
speaking to him. When we're first introduced to Jeff and Poo, they temporarily
become silent protagonists as well, until they meet up with Ness.

For now, all nonessential dialogue, such as from random townspeople, is being
omitted. If there's a large enough demand, maybe that'll change. The one
exception to this is Mr. Saturn. At the end of the guide, I have set aside a
section for Mr. Saturn quotes.

I ask that people do not lift my guide or portions of my guide without asking
my permission or without giving me credit.

Now, without further ado, I present the story of Earthbound.

The year is 199X


Onett, a small town in Eagleland


Ness's house


(Pokey)
'Hey, Ness.
'Don't be rubberneckin'. You're gettin' in the cops, oops...
'I mean officer's way!
'You can go home now.
'Tomorrow I, Pokey, will tell you more about the strange meteorite.
'I'm fine here, but you're bugging the officers!


(Mom)
'Welcome home, Ness.
'It's not necessary to talk about it tonight.
'It's late, scoot off to bed now.
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "No":
'Oh, Ness. You don't understand the importance of a good night's sleep!


Later that night...


(Pokey)
'Hey! L-L-Listen to what I've got to say!
'When I took Picky to the place where the meteorite landed...
'Oh! Good evening ma'am. You're looking lovely as usual. *snicker*
'Anyway, as I was saying,
'the police that were guarding the meteorite landing left suddenly
'to deal with the Sharks. You know the Sharks, they're the local ruffians,
'and they were really going wild. Suddenly, I noticed that Picky was gone.
'I blame the cops... it certainly wasn't my fault at all.
'When my dad gets back, I know I'm gonna get it...
'You're my bestest friend. Won't YOU help me find Picky?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "No":
'If you refuse me, I'll say something that'll cut you like a knife.
'Will you come with me?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "No":
'Okay, okay... I won't say anything to hurt you.
'Will you please come with me?
  >>Yes
  >>No

{Repeats until "Yes"}

'Ok, good buddy! Let's blow this popsicle stand...
'Before we go, why don't you say "goodbye" to your mom. Don't you agree, ma'am?


(Mom)
'I know that the dog is unreliable, but you should take King along.
'The Cracked Bat in Tracy's room could help out at a time like this...
'No matter what anyone says, you're a courageous, strong boy.
'You're my very own natural born fighter...You'll go far...
'Remember to "Go for it!"
'But, I think you should change out of your jammies before you leave.


(Pokey)
'All right! You go out in front, and I'll follow at a safe distance.
'Let's get going!
'(Pokey joins you.)


(Ringing Phone)
'Ness answered the phone.
'Hello, it's your dad.
'"Work to exhaustion when you're young..."
'Have you ever heard of a weird saying like this?
'Just remember, I'm always behind you 100%. Don't be afraid.
'I know that you're brave. You can do it!
'Don't forget to call me periodically during your adventure.
'I can make a record of your progress when you call me.
'Oh yeah, I deposited $30 into your bank account.
'Do you have your ATM card?
'Withdraw your money from any cash machine and buy whatever you need.
'Good Luck, m'boy! I feel like such a hero!
'What? Well, the father of a hero, at least. Wa ha ha!
'Slam! Beeeeeeeep!


(King)
'(Do you want me to go with you?)
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "No":
'(Oh, I get it. You just wanted to talk to me because I'm so lovable.)

If "Yes":
'(I guess I have no choice. Let's go.)
'King joins you.


(King)
'Awooooof!
'(If I knew this was going to be such a scary place,
'I wouldn't have come along... I'm outta here!)


(Picky)
'Wha-!
'Oh!
'You woke me up...
'Pokey! I've been looking all over for you...
'You see, Pokey got scared and ran away...
'Well, I'm glad that you're okay at least...
'Let's go home now. I bet Mom and Dad are worried sick about us.
'Geez! Sometimes I wonder which one of us is the real big brother.
'(Picky joins you.)


(Pokey or Picky)
'Ness!
'Do you hear a buzzing that sounds like a bee flying around?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "No":
'Oh c'mon... You must hear it...

If "Yes":
'Yes! You can hear it!


(Bee)
'A bee I am
'not...
'I'm from 10 years in the future.
'And,
'in the future, all is devastation...
'Giygas, the universal cosmic destroyer,
'send all to the horror of eternal darkness...
'.....
'However, you must listen!
'Where I am from,
'there is a well-known legend that has been handed down from ancient times.
'It says "When the chosen boy reaches the point, he will find the light.
'The passing of time will shatter the nightmare rock
'and will reveal the path of light."
'You see, it is my opinion that you are that boy, Ness.
'This I believe...
'.....
'Giygas' monstrous plan must have been set in motion somewhere on Earth...
'If you start to confront the enemy immediately,
'you may have time to counter the evil intentions of Giygas.
'Three things are of the utmost importance: wisdom, courage, and friendship.
'...The legends from the ancient times tell of three boys and a girl
'who defeat Giygas.
'...I will tell you more later.
'Go now! And do not be anxious about the future.
'You have much work to do, Ness.
'Did you listen to what I told you?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "No":
'I hate to go over it again, but I guess I'll start over...
'We'll be here 'til sunrise!

{Repeat until "Yes"}

'Thank you for listening to my long story.
'You are as exceptional as I expected you to be...
'Buzz Buzz now joins you.


(Pokey)
'Ness!
'It looks like you're really in a lot of trouble this time...
'Three boys, he said? ...Uhhh...
'I'm not one of those three, am I?...
'...'Cause... I'm not into this kind of thing at all...
'Geez. My heart is almost pounding right out of my chest!...


(Starman Junior)
'It's been a long time, Buzz Buzz.
'You've been successful at foiling Master Giygas' plans.
'But... Buzz Buzz, you must now surrender.
'You're not longer a hero, but just a useless insect.
'I'll stomp you hard!


(Buzz Buzz)
'Whew!... I was taking a big chance there...
'He came from 10 years in the future to kill me, so we can't relax yet!
'From now on, you'll be fighting enemies sent by Giygas,
'as well as humans who have evil thoughts.
'They'll definitely make trouble during your adventure!
'Animals are also becoming violent
'due to Giygas' influence over the evil in their minds!
'It is the truth, so listen!


(Pokey's Dad)
'I'm really sorry that my kids troubled you so much...
'Both of you are really going to get it now!

'By the way, I would be happy if you left sometime soon.
'I'm tired of your family living next door.
'We've loaned your father a lot of money.
'It may have been a hundred thousand dollars or more...
'Well, I guess it really could have been less,
'but because of the loan, my family and I now live in poverty!


(Pokey's Mom)
'My husband is much too lenient with the children.
'Oh well, nice guys finish last. That's the story of our life...

'Ayaaaeee!
'I think it's a dung beetle! I'll smash your guts out!


(Buzz Buzz)
'Agh! *gasp* I was...
'...much weaker than I thought...
'So you must now begin your adventure...
'see...
'you...
'Oh, I just remembered...
'Listen to my final words...
'To defeat Giygas, your own power must unite with the Earth's...
'the Earth will then channel your power and multiply it...
'There are eight points that you must visit. Make these places your own...
'Each of these locations is "Your Sanctuary."
'One of them is near Onett. It is called "Giant Step."
'Go there first...
'Do you understand?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "No":
'...I see.
'I apologize. I guess I didn't explain it well enough...

{Repeat until "Yes"}

'All right.
'You are a very intelligent young man... and...
'Oh! The pain!... Everything is getting dark...
'urgh!... *Gasp*...
'Before I pass on, I want to give you something...
'It is the Sound Stone.
'You can record the melodies from the eight "Your Sanctuary" locations
'into this stone. It is an awesome item...
'By the way... I'm almost gone,
'but did you want to hear the story one more time?

If "Yes":
'Oh, okay...

{Repeat until "No"}

'Good!
'It's already dawn outside...
'But it doesn't matter to me. I'm fading fast...
'Argh! *Gasp*
'(Ness got the Sound Stone.)


(Shark A)
'It was you! YOU beat up my buddy, didn't you?
'You'd better just beat it!

(Shark B)
'Hey kid! Do you wanna become a member?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "Yes":
'Come back after you finish EarthBound!

If "No":
'Don't be such a snob!


(Frank)
'.....
'...I'm Frank. You are?
'C'mon, can't you at least say your name?


(Frank)
'"Fail-proof" Frank can't be beaten.
'Puff, puff, puff And this is "Frankystein Mark II."


(Frank)
'...This is my first defeat.
'"Fail-proof" Frank is now just "failure" Frank.
'I know you've been asking around, so I'll tell you about Giant Step.
'It... seems... to be quite a powerful spot.
'Some kind of special power is stored there
'that allows certain people to perform wondrous feats.
'However... a monster sucked up all the energy at that spot.
'It's difficult to get to Giant Step. That's all I know...
'I suggest you collect more information on your own.
'The entrance to the path leading to Giant STep is
'behind the touring entertainers' shack.
'Pirkle, the Mayor of Onett, has a key to the shack.
'Ness, you've become stronger than I! Your adventure is just beginning...


(Pirkle)
'Hey hey hey! I'm Mayor B.H. Pirkle. It's so nice to meet you.
'You beat up the town bullies,
'punched them out big time, kicked their butts, bit their heads off,
'spit in their eyes, and made them wet their pants.
'Then you forced them to promise not to make any more trouble. Thank you!
'What? You want a key to the touring entertainers' shack?
'For someone as great as you, giving you the key could help keep the town
peaceful.
'However, if you encounter a dangerous situation,
'please don't ask me to take any responsibility.
'I'll be able to avoid any responsibility, right?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "No":
'I'm a very important man in these parts. Do you think I'm important?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "No":
'Look, I'm the big cheese around here,
'and a brat like you should realize when someone is trying to be nice.

If "Yes" to either:
'You're such a smart kid... Here's the key to the shack.
'(Ness got the Key to the shack.)


(Titanic Ant)
'You finally got here.
'This is the first "Your Sanctuary" location. But it's mine now.
'Take it from me, if you dare...


(Giant Step)
'Ness caught a glimpse of a small, cute puppy.
'Ness's Sound Stone recorded the melody of Giant Step.


(Cop)
'Hey you, the board says "Do Not Enter." Couldn't you read it?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "No":
'What a rebellious kid! Come to the Onett Police Station later!


(Dream)
'.....
'Ness?
'...
'Ness
'...Ness...
'I'm a friend who you have never met before...
'My name is Paula.
'Can you hear me calling you?
'I am Paula...
'...
'.....


(Captain Strong)
'Why is the road to Twoson closed? An emergency, of course.
'At times like this, kids like you should be playing Nintendo games.
'Anyway, are you sure you want to go to Twoson?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "No":
'Well then, perhaps you should just crawl back to your shack, little mister.

If "Yes":
'Okay, *chortle* Follow me.

'Show me what you got...
'See if you can get past five of my best men...


(Cop 1)
'Eeeeyah!
'Hey, small fry! You must be shaking in your boots!

(Cop 1)
'You're tough. You should join the police force!


(Cop 2)
'Your average policeman is stronger than any super hero!

(Cop 2)
'Oh... you won...


(Cop 3)
'Don't let the Mayor's compliments give you a big head...
'Bring it on, fat boy!

(Cop 3)
'Let's do this again sometime...
'Next time, I'll take you out with my nuclear suplex attack!


(Cop 4)
'C'mon! I'm going to take you apart right here, right now, baby!

(Cop 4)
'Grrr... I lost...


(Cop 5)
'That's it, buddy...
'You can forget about me, I'm going to call for my boss!


(Captain Strong)
'There is no way I can beat you in a straight competition, so...
'get ready for my "Super Ultra Mambo-Tango-Foxtrot martial arts!"

(Captain Strong)
'I didn't think you would do so well against the mighty Onett police force...
'You want me to open the road to Twoson?
'Hang on for a sec, I'll radio my staff and give them the word...
'*Beep, beep* ...*Click*... *Rrrr*
'*Click* Strong here... do you read me?
'...*Krrrr* ...Hey!...
'...It's me, Captain Strong!...
'Okay, listen, a kid named Ness will be there in a few minutes...
'He's a kid in a red cap... I want you to open the road to Twoson for him...
'I know that...
'I know that!...
'Don't ask me why, just do it! That's an order! ...Strong out...
'Well kid, I'm not going to question you now,
'but I do want to see you again...
'Good luck!

(Everdred)
'Wah ha ha ha ha! Why don't we chat later-after we've locked horns!

(Everdred)
'Yes, I'm Everdred, boss of Burglin Park.
'When I jumped off the roof, I twisted my ankle.
'Anyway, I lost and nothing will change that.
'You know, you're pretty strong.
'Yeah, I know that you want to find out about a girl named Paula.
'She went off to a secret hideout in the Peaceful Rest Valley.
'A chubby boy and a weird guy in a blue outfit have kidnapped her, though.
'They said that they were going to make Paula some sort of human sacrifice.
'They were definitely hard-core strange.
'You know, she might be gone already. You'd better hurry.
'If you save Paula, be sure to come back here, okay? Don't forget!

(Paula's Dad)
'So, you wanna see Paula?
'Many come here to see her miraculous powers, but they're just leeches.
'So... are you from a TV station, or what?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "Yes":
'Please leave.
'My daughter doesn't want to talk to media monkeys like you.

If "No":
'To meet you or not to meet you can only be decided by Paula.
'Paula has said that she would only meet with a boy named Ness.
'So you're Ness!
'You're the one that was in Paula's dream.
'You will save the world!
'Let me go call Paula.

'She doesn't seem to be here.
'I wonder where she went? I'm sorry, could you come back later?


(Apple Kid)
'Well, I have sort of neglected doing my housework...
'I know it's a bit of a pig sty, but anyway...
'I'm Apple Kid.
'I haven't taken a bath in quite a while, so I may be kind of stinky.
'By the way, I'm starving. Do you have something to eat?
'If you do, can I have some?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "No":
'Well, go ahead and make yourself comfortable anyway. You can flop down
anywhere.

If "Yes":
'What can you give me?

If choose a non-food:
'Please choose something edible... I'm not a garbage can, you know.

If choose a food dish:
'Thanks. You seem very nice. Uh, I wonder if...
'Maybe you would like to invest some money in my inventions?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "No," then talk again:
'It seems like you are expecting something from me.
'Maybe you would like to invest some money in my inventions?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "Yes":
'Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh. Excuse me. I mean thank you!
'By the way, I could really use $200.
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "Yes" but insufficient money:
'Oh, you don't have any money, do you?

If "Yes":
'Thank you. I won't let you down.


(Mouse)
'I am a mouse. No one has given me a name yet.
'You took care of my master.
'In return, I want to give you this. Please take it and say nothing.
'(Ness got the Receiver phone).
'Oh! I must be in your way! *zziipp!*


(Pencil Statue)
'(For some weird reason,
'a pencil-shaped iron statue is blocking the path.)


(Receiver Phone)
'Hello... this is Apple Kid.
'I've just finished work on this great invention!
'Get over here as fast as you can! This thing is soooo cool!
'See you soon! Slam! Beeeep...


(Dream)
'.....
'Ness!
'I...Paula...
'I am Paula...
'Can you hear me calling you?
'Help!
'Come and help me!
'Um, I don't know where I am...
'I can hear water running in the distance...
'Ness, please help me!


(Paula's Dad)
'P P P Paula! Where are you? It's time for a yummy piece of pie!


(Apple Kid)
'I'm feeling really out of it because I've been working all night,
'but finally the Pencil eraser is ready.
'This machine will eradicate all pencil-shaped figures in just one second.
'It's incredibly powerful. Just don't use it near a shop that sells pencils.
'Here, it's yours now.
'(Ness got the Pencil eraser.)
'If I invent some other brilliant item, I'll call you.


(Paula)
'...Who?...
'...Are you Ness?
'Ness! I'm so glad it's you.
'I had a dream that a boy named Ness was my destiny.
'I know it's hard to believe.
'Therefore, I knew you would rescue me.
'If you didn't come, I would have had to try to bust out of here.
'You can't open the door.
'You'll have to get the key from Carpainter. He's got it hidden away.
'I heard Carpainter can control lightning.
'In that case, you should wear this Franklin badge, okay?
'(Ness got the Franklin badge.)
'I'll wait here until you return.
'Come back here and get me out once you defeat Carpainter.
'Don't worry about me, just kick butt like I know you can!


(Pokey)
'Hey Ness! You're just here to bother me, aren't you.
'You can call me Master Pokey,
'since Mr. Carpainter made me an important person in Happy-Happyism.
'You should join us, but I know you won't... I'm glad I joined...
'I'm not going to fight you, but these guys will... Later potater...


(Mr. Carpainter)
'Thanks for coming! I've been waiting for you.
'I need your assistance to help make the world blue
'and change it into a happy and peaceful society.
'Will you be my right-hand assistant?
  >>Yes
  >>No

Either answer:
'You fool, I have drawn you into my trap.
'Carpainter's lightning was reflected by the Franklin Badge.

(Mr. Carpainter)
'Do you see the Mani Mani Statue behind me...
'Since I got the statue, I have been doing peculiar things.
'Please forgive me, if you can... I just wanted to have a normal life.
'I apologize to everyone.
'Here's the key to open the jail in the mountain cabin where Paula is being
held.
'Take the key and go.
'(Ness got the Key to the cabin.)


(Pokey)
'What a horrible nightmare. I somehow woke up.
'Ness, let's be friends again.
'Please answer me. I promise to be good. ...uh ...okay?
'Hah! I lied! See you, sucker!


(Paula)
'Thank you, Ness!
'You're just like I imagined you would be...
'I'm sure that some people in Twoson are worried about me...
'Getting back there may be dangerous,
'but we can do it if we combine our strength.
'I'm able to use a little psychic power that is actually pretty deadly...
'Let's head back to Twoson!
'Paula joined you.


(Mondo Mole)
'You finally got here.
'This is the second "Your Sanctuary" location. But it's mine now.
'Take it from me, if you dare...


(Lilliput Steps)
'Ness briefly had a vision of a baby in a red cap.
'Ness's Sound Stone recorded the melody of Lilliput Steps.


(Paula's Dad)
'Oh Paula!
'Ness, thank you so much!
'You must be the boy who will save the world, like in Paula's dream.
'Paula, I'm sure you'd be a big help to Ness.
'It's not every day a father lets his daughtre embark on a journey to save the
world!

(Paula)
'Dad, don't worry about me.
'Ness and I will be able to take care of ourselves.
'In Threed, the next town, we'll meet another friend.
'If the three of us can combine our power, no one can beat us.
'Now wipe your eyes, blow your nose, and smile before we take off.

(Paula's Dad)
'Goodbye Paula. Don't worry, I won't cry anymore...

(Thug)
'Hello? Ness?
'Everdred is looking for you.
'He's got something for you.


(Everdred)
'I was going to ask you to be my partner,
'but I know you'll refuse. It's written all over your face.
'If you accepted, I was going to give you some money.
'Actually, I can't keep the money now anyway. Let me give this to you.
'It's 10,000 dollars.
'Use the money any way you like. You cannot refuse my generosity. Just accept
it.
'Now I plan on looking for the evil Mani Mani Statue.
'that Lier X. Agerate unearthed in Onett.
'I'll see you at another time, in another space.
'(Ness got the Wad of bills.)


(Runaway Five Member)
'Hey, ya came with Paula!
'Then you deserve a present, playboy.
'Here's a Backstage pass. You can get into our shows with this!
'(Ness got the Backstage pass.)


(Poochyfud)
'Yipes! You surprised me. Now I'm not sure what to do.
'I got the money, of course, and now the Runaway Five are free to leave.
'I've got no complaints now that I have my money.


(Runaway Five Member 1)
'Well, what do you know?
'This little nipper took us from a nightmare to a dream...

(Runaway Five Member 2)
'Ow! That means we can get out of this dump!

(Runaway Five Member 3)
'I'm a good driver. C'mon, I'll show you.

(Runaway Five Member 4)
'All right, let's move on to the next town.
'I'm sure our ol' hunk o' junk will get us there...

(Runaway Five Member 5)
'I didn't make a spectacle of myself, did I?


(Runaway Five Member)
'Let's go to Threed!
'Our tour bus is too loud for any ghosts to bother us.
'Do you want a ride?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "No":
'If ya change your mind, come back anytime.

If "Yes":
'Oh yeah! Let's go! Get on the bus!


(Tour Bus)
'Okay, guys, here we go!

'You know the dorm rules, right?
'If you get caught, you'll get punished big time...
'W... what's wrong, Jeff.
'...All right.
'There must be some reason that I don't understand. I won't stop you.
'But it's dangerous to leave without takign anything along.
'Hey, I think there's some stuff in the locker room that you should get.
'I'll help you get out of here...
'(Tony joined you.)

'Oh, Jeff and Tony. You startled me.
'Are you looking for a late night snack?

'He'd be able to provide a great deal of help.
'I heard he's an astounding person.
'He was the first leader of our Ultra Science Club...
'I heard he's greater than Einstien or Heisenberg.
'Rumor has it he's also very strange.
'If you're heading to the locker room, take this key along.
'It's a little bent though.
'(Jeff got the Key to the locker.)
'If you leave, call me, and I'll record your adventure.
'It's like saving the game. Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.


(Locker)
'(The key is bent and doesn't fit into the key hole!)


(Maxwell)
'Hah, ha, ha. The key didn't work, did it?
'I thought that might be the case. So I just invented the...
'"Machine that Opens Doors, especially when you have a slightly bad key."
'Sorry for the inconvenience.
'(Jeff got the Bad key machine.)
'If you are Dr. Andonut's son,
'you should be able to repair small tools and make them useful.
'Just try to keep a positive attitude.

'Okay, now use me as a step and climb over the gate.
'Well... I'll say goodbye for now.

'but remember, we are best friends forever.

'Hello, this is Apple Kid.
'I just wanted to let you know that I finished a pretty unique invention.
'I'm not sure if it will help you or not...
'It's called "Zombie Paper," and it can be used to trap zombies.
'It works kind of like fly paper...
'All you need to do is place the paper on the floor of a tent or something...
'You've seen at least one tent around, right?....
'and then the zombies get stuck to the paper
'when they move around inside the tent.
'You can catch a lot of zombies this way... In fact,
'I bet you could get rid of all the zombies
'that are terrorizing the area with this paper!
'Anyway, I just asked teh Mach Pizza delivery man
'to deliver the Zombie Paper to you, Ness.
'You should get it pretty soon.
'I've never actually seen a zombie, but if there really are any,
'Zombie Paper would be very useful...
'I'll be calling you if I come up with anything else...
'*Click!* Beeeeep!

'While delivering pizza, this weird guy asked me to help him out...
'He wanted me to deliver this to someone named Ness
'...who is wandering around Threed.
'No one else knows about this, right?
'Let's just pretend that you're Ness, and I'll give this to you.
'Oh! Hello, Ness!
'Just go along with me on this one, okay.

________________
6.1 Coffee Break

    You've traveled very far from
    home...

    Do you remember how your long
    and winding journey began with
    someone pounding at your door?
    It was Pokey, the worst person in
    your neighborhood, who knocked
    on the door that fateful night.

    On your way, you have walked,
    thought and fought. Yet through
    all this, you have never lost your
    courage. You have grown steadily
    stronger, though you have
    experienced the pain of battle
    many times.

    You are no longer alone in your
    adventure, Paula who is
    steadfast, kand and even pretty,
    is always at your side.
    Jeff is with you as well.
    Though he is timid, he came from
    a distant land to help you.
    Ness, as you certainly
    know by now, you are not a
    regular young man... You have
    an awesome destiny to fulfill.

    The journey from this point will
    be long, and it will be more
    difficult than anything you have
    undergone to this point. Yet, I
    know you will be all right. When
    good battles evil, which side do
    you believe wins? Do you have
    faith that good is triumphant?

    One thing you must never lose is
    courage. If you believe in the
    goal you are striving for, you will
    be courageous. There are many
    difficult times ahead, but you
    must keep your sense of humor,
    work through the tough
    situations and enjoy yourself.

    When you have finished this cup
    of coffee, your adventure will
    begin again. NExt you must pass
    though a vast desert and
    proceed to the big city of
    Fourside.

       Ness...
          Paula...
             Jeff...

    I wish you luck...

'Next, I will tear your arms off...
'I shall then take your arms and feed them to the crows.
'The taking of your arms...
'Do you accept this?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "Yes":
'Ah, Prince Poo...
'Without legs and arms, you can only lie there...
'Now, I'll cut your ears off.
'You do not mind my taking your hearing away, do you?
'Do you accept this?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "Yes":
'(So, Prince Poo.
'No legs, no arms and no sound...
'By floating words through the air, I must ask you...
'Do you care if I take your eyes?
'Do you want to live in eternal darkness?
'I shall steal your sight...
'Do you accept this?)
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "Yes":
'(So, Prince Poo.
'Now, I can only communicate directly with your mind.
'Your mind is all you have left...
'In the end, I will take your mind,
'though you probably don't want to allow that, do you?
'So... you can't answer? You can't even move?
'Are you sad, are you lonely?
'If you lose your mind, you also lose any feelings of sadness...
'Do you accept this?
'I will take your mind, Prince Poo, know that I will possess it...)


(Man)
'Prince Poo!
'You have now completed your training!
'The old Master must be so pleased!
'Hurry, now, and return to the palace.


(Master)
'I am proud.
'You have completed your Mu training.
'There is nothing more to teach you from the holy writings.
'Prince Poo,
'I shall relay a message to you from Eternity.
'The evil entity that controls all wickedness is preparing for
'the greatest struggle of all time...
'The only ones who can challenge the entity are three boys and one girl.
'Once named Ness is the leader of the four.
'One of the boys is you, Prince Poo.
'Now that you've completed your training, search out Ness at once.
'For all beings, for the earth herself.
'I pray for growth in the might of the four.

(Mr. Fork)
'...mumble, mumble...
'Why would Mr. Spoon from the Fourside museum try to call me?
'I bet he just wants to brag about something...
'Well, let him try... I wonder what he wants to tell me?
'Bah! I dare him to try and upstage me...
'Oh! Pardon me... I was just talking to myself... *cough*

'This room is being remodeled, so I can't show it to you...
'Oh, the samurai kid is here.

  >>Yes
  >>No

If "Yes":
'You're such a good student.
'I'm impressed by your passion for learning. Come in.

If "No":
'Excuse me?
'So, what he just handed me is not a gem.
'Hah ha ha.
'I'm going to really enjoy the "cookie" that I just got.
'Let's pretend this conversation never took place...
'While I'm pretending, you go on in...


(Poo)
'(Poo read the Hieroglyphs!)
'"To fight against invaders, we built this pyramid fortress.
'However, our efforts were futile, and we lost.
'Nonetheless, our pyramid was protected by the gods of Scaraba.
'The invaders will be reborn every millenium and will attack again.
'Even now, the invaders hide beyond space and time and build their evil
stronghold.
'A place out of time is beyond the Dark, and is even farther beyond the Lost
Underworld.
'The Deep Darkness is shrouded, it is without light.
'Only one with the Hawk eye can pierce the dark.

'It's a reward for studying so hard.
'(Ness got the Hieroglyph copy.)
'Use it in your Human Civilization class.
'Ha ha ha!


(Ringing Phone)
'Hello!
'Is this Mr. Fork of the Scaraba Cultural Museum?...
'It doesn't sound like you...
'Well, I'll quickly tell you my story, 'cause I'm busy, busy, busy!
'I found something so extraordinary that mere words could not do it justice.
'What do you mean "who am I"?
'Don't you recognize my voice?
'It's me, Mr. Spoon from the Fourside Museum of Natural History!
'Look Mr. Fork, I'm not exaggerating this find!
'I'm telling you...
'It's fantastic!...
'It's outrageous!...
'*Click* Beeeeep


(Mr. Spoon)
'Do you want to know about something "extraordinary"?
'.....
'Hmmmm...
'...You know, there's a new singer named Venus at the Topolla Theater.
'Could you bring me her autograph on an eraser?
'Then, I'll show you something "extraordinary."
'...Oh, if you can get her autograph on anything, don't worry about the
eraser...
'I don't care if the autograph is written on toilet paper...


(MC)
'Oh, baby baby baaabyyy!
'Don't make me hurt so bad!
'These guys are all stone cold gone for you...
'Ow!! ...You cute, sexy thing, you!...
'Baby, sing to me!... Sing to me only!... Baby!! Venus!
'Just sing, and I can die a happy man!... Baby!!...
'I wanna hold you tight!... Venus!... Baby!...
'*Boo, hoo, hoo* ...Venus!... *sob* *sob*


(Guard)
'Ah, you're a friend of the Runaway Five...
'Did you come to see Miss Venus? Come inside quickly.
'Don't let the other fans see you enter.


(Venus)
'Oh, you want an autograph?
'Okay, I'll give you my autograph on this banana peel...
'Here you go.
'(Ness got the Signed banana.)
'Oh, and this is a bonus...
'Smack!


(Mr. Spoon)
'You got it!
'That banana peel has an authentic "Venus" autograph?
'Yup, there's no doubt about it!
'Now for my promise.
'I'll tell you about something "extraordinary."
'In the next room, there is a light shining from far, far below the manhole.
'There, I found a huge, monster rat!
'I'm not trying to pull your leg...
'I'll let you go there and check it out yourself.


(Plague Rat of Doom)
'You finally got here.
'This is the fifth "Your Sanctuary" location. But it's mine now.
'Take it from me, if you dare...


(Magnet Hill)
'Ness saw a baby's bottle, but just for an instant.
'Ness's Sound Stone recorded the melody of Magnet Hill.

'Ness used the Carrot key.
'(How strange! The rabbits and carrots disappeared all at once!)

'Thank you! You made my wife wake up.
'She quit talking about all that serious crap...
'Yeah! Let's work hard!
'If you're courageous, get on this boat.
'You'll probably see the Kraken and experience getting seasick!
'After all, it could only cost you your life, and you got that for free!
'Luck will determine the outcome of this voyage.
'So, do you want to sail the seas to Scaraba?
'Twenty bucks per person is fine with me.
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "No":
'I understand.
'Stay here and shiver in fear for your future!
'Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

If "Yes":
'Ready! We're reckless, baby!
'Bon Voyage!

'WAAAAIT! Wait! Wait...
'I need to stop the boat.
'It's been a long time since I was out on the open sea, so I feel seasick...
'Oh, man, what am I going to do? A sailor who gets seasick?
'So how come you guys are all right?
'So... that bald guy over there...
'your buddy, right?... He came from Dalaam?
'You guys must be quite the adventurers!
'Hahaha! I'm feeling much better now!
'Anchors aweigh!

'You must decide what you really are. Therefore, what will you do?

'Warriors, enter now. Search for the Hawk eye.

'Do you want to get it?)

'Well done.
'You have made it!
'We finally meet, Prince Poo.
'The stars foretold that I would meet you here...
'So, now it's the time to show you the way of the Starstorm...
'For a while, you must live far away from your friends and live with me.
'Do you understand?
'...There's only one answer.
'I must stop you here even if you don't want to.
'Stay with me for a while, do you understand?!

(Poo)
'It is important that I study and learn the "Starstorm"...
'It will be most helpful to us.
'Once I learn it, I'll meet up with you, Ness.
'Trust me... I will see you again.

(Old Man)
'It depends on Poo's efforts. That will determine the reuniting of the group.
'Be faithful, and wait until the time comes!


(Native)
'I'm not sure if it was the "Dungeon Man," but...
'there is a strange looking tower to the northwest.
'...This key I picked up a little while ago shall maybe open the tower.
'You may have it, I do not need it.
'(Ness got the Key to the tower.)


'Ness used the Key to the tower.
'(The key worked to open the door.
You may enter.)


(Brick Road)
'Welcome!
'Long time, no see.
'Mr. Jeff, we met in Winters a long time ago.
'I'm Brick Road.
'Dr. Andonuts finally made me Dungeon Man.
'If you want, I'll come with you guys for a while.
'The "Return Hole" is over there.
'Jump in that hole and then walk out.


(Brick Road)
'Guargh! Oh no! I... am...
'getting caught in the palm trees! Mmm... I cannot move.
'Well, if I cannot move, it is okay.
'Ness, it makes me sad,
'but I must say goodbye here, at my eternal resting place.


(Native)
'A scary place called Deep Darkness is on the other side of the river.
'The monsters are very strong and you can lose your health
'just by wandering in the swamp.
'Do you want to cross the river, even though you know it's a stupid idea?

If "No":
'It was stupid of me to ask.
'Let's watch the sunset over Deep Darkness together from here.

If "Yes":
'The swamp is bottomless.
'Even if you're swimming, you'll be dragged in.
'It is a different story if you have a submarine.


(Brick Road)
'A submarine?
'I believe... that I have on in my old vehicle collection.
'Please enter...


(Brick Road)
'There's an old submarine in the back of the dungeon.
'It can be used to cross the river.
'There's a "Goodbye Exit" ...over there.
'It will take you to the submarine.
'Don't make a mistake on which exit you take.
'You need to take the "Goodbye Exit!" Hope to see you again!


(Jeff)
'(Jeff checked the broken submarine.)
'Yes! It can still work.

'By the way, Apple Kid is missing.
'He left here saying that he was going to see Dr. Andonuts in Winters,
'and he never came back.
'I was hopinh to borrow the book "Overcoming Shyness" from him,
'but suddenly, he disappeared...
'I haven't read the book, so I'm not very good at talking... sorry.

'Oh, hi Ness.
'It's another nice day. What? You'd like the book "Overcoming Shyness"?
'I've read it. It's a great book. So you want to overcome shyness also?
'You should be able to find it on the bookcase.

'Book!
'Can fix shyness.
'Thanks.

14.1 Tea Break


    Like a great tapestry, vertical and
    horizontal threads have met and
    become intertwined, creating a
    huge, beautiful image.


    You may have cursed this never-
    ending journey. You have known
    injury and defeat, but you have
    struggled on to reach this place.
    Your in-born intelligence and
    courage have helped bring you
    here. You have believed in your
    friends, and as a group, you have
    supported each other. Have you
    ever stopped to consider how
    much your power has grown?
    Now, you could fell enemies in
    Onett and Twoson with one
    blow. As you certainly know,
    you cannot turn back. Giygas,
    the arch field of the universe, is
    growing frightened of you and
    your power. He is searching for
    ways to end your journey.


    From here, the challenge grows
    and your adventure will take you
    beyond anything you ever
    imagined. You are drawing near
    to Giygas. Remember when you
    are suffering hardships, your
    enemy is also struggling.


    By the way, do you know where
    Pokey went? When this cup of
    tea is finished, your adventure will
    continue. Your destiny pulls you
    in the right direction. Believe in
    yourself and press forward.


    Ness!

         Paula!

               Jeff!

                     Poo!



    I wish you luck...

'Finally, you talk to me.
'Listen Ness.
'I'm going to tell you something very important.
'You may want to take notes.
'Ready?
'You're the chosen one.
'Your destiny is not only yours...
'It's the destiny of the whole universe.
'There will be a time in which all of you in the universe will overlap each
other.
'It's not necessary to understand now.
'Do you remember "Giant Step" in Onett?
'That is one of "Your Sanctuary."
'It is a spot which gives you power
'and allows you to realize all your skills.
'There was a monster that protected it.
'The monster was influenced by a power of the place.
'You must have beaten those monsters.
'You must reach all of the eight power spots in the world...
'When the Sound Stone records the melodies of all eight power spots,
'you can finally see "Your World."
'I'll tell you all of the power spots.
'1. "Giant Step" in Onett.
'2. "Lilliput Steps" in Peaceful Rest Valley near Twoson.
'3. "Milky Well" in Grapefruit Falls in Saturn Valley.
'4. "Rainy Circle" found by Jeff in Winters.
'5. "Magnet Hill" at the edge of the city of Fourside.
'6. "Pink Cloud" which Poo knows.
'7. and... "Lumine Hole" where the shining lichen lives in the cave.
'8. A new place is now going to be opened up to you.
'"Fire Spring," located southwest of here.
'Listen to the melodies of all eight power spots.
'If you do not fail, you may upset Giygas' plans...
'Understand, Ness?
'The time will come.
'The time when the destiny of you and the whole universe will overlap...
'It is fast approaching.

'This is getting most fascinating!


(Dr. Andonuts)
'Finally, it's complete!
'The Phase Distorter, version two,
'is equipped with two new features.
'First, it can repair your biological functions.
'Second, it can save your progress.
'Don't be afraid, get right in!
'...There is just one thing, though...
'You might not be able to return. So, make sure you are optimally outfitted.
'Are you ready to go?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "No":
'Even if you're not 100%, perfectly, completely ready...
'Well, you should be as prepared as possible. It would be for the best.
'Without careful preparation, you would be in big trouble.
'I just want to make sure you're ready.
'Let me know when your preparations are complete.

'Good. At last, the time has come.
'Are you ready?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "Yes":
'Remember, the Phase Distorter, version 2,
'is equipped with two new features.
'First, it can repair your biological functions.
'Second, it can save your progress.
'Don't be afraid! Get right in!


(Old Man)
'Greetings! So, you are finally here!
'Excellent! You are truly excellent!
'There is only a little time left! I'll give you the last power.
'I must go now...
'(Poo became conscious of PSI Starstorm Omega!)


(Mr. Saturn)
'KiDnaPPED. i waS. BOinG!
'KiDnaPPER. BaD GUy.
'Bad GUy GOnE. zOOm!
'wHERE? tO tHE PaSt.
'DinG, DinG!


(Apple Kid)
'The Phase Distorter has been completed.
'We could finish it quickly because of Mr. Saturn's incredible scientific
skill...


(Dr. Andonuts)
'Giygas is attacking from our exact location,
'but he is attacking from many years in the past.


(Apple Kid)
'You must warp to the past and fight, but...


(Dr. Andonuts)
'This is very hard for me to tell you, but...


(Dr. Andonuts)
'In order to defeat Giygas, who is attacking from the past,
'you must warp to the past.
'This can be done by way of the "Phase Distorter 3."
'However, the machine cannot warp living things, I mean lifeforms.
'Life is demolished in the process of warping.'
'The only way to accomplish the time travel is
'to transfer your brain "program" into a robot,
'and send the robot to the past.
'...The transfer means that your spirit will go with the robot
'while your body is left behind...
'I cannot promise that your spirit will come back after the battle in the past.
'Yes, you must understand that the four of you are the chosen ones.
'Do you still wish to face Giygas by travelling to the past?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "No":
'Yes, it's natural to feel as you go.
'The only thing left is the destruction of our planet...

If "Yes":
'...Hmmm ...you accept this while knowing
'that you may not be able to return to your current form,
'right?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "Yes":
'...Yes... I see... You have really set your mind on this...
'Let me take a good look at you now...
'Ness, please give me that red cap...
'Ready... stand by...


(Dr. Andonuts)
'Ness! Paula! Poo!
'Jeff!... my son...
'There is no turning back now.
'Ness, activate the Phase Distorter 3 by your own hand,
'thereby following your own destiny...
'Will you do so?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "No":
'...I see...
'Jeff! You do it!
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "No":
'Oh, you lost your nerve...
'Ness! It is up to you...
  >>Yes
  >>No

{Repeat until "Yes"}

'Only a few people know of your amazing courage,
'but the number of people you save through that bravery is immense.
'I feel very fortunate...
'to be present at the beginning of this monumental undertaking...

&                                 18.0 Giygas                                 &
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+


(Pokey)
'Ness! Are you surprised?
'It's me, Pokey.
'I assist only the strong and able!
'That's Pokey.
'You guys look pathetic!
'The Apple of Enlightenment has already made a prediction.
'...But I won't let what the Apple of Enlightenment predicted take place.
'You guys will be beaten by Giygas.
'Giygas will be stronger, a more powerful entity than any other!
'Why?
''Cause of me.
'I was led by Giygas, and now I'm here.
'The Apple of Enlightenment couldn't predict this.
'Master Giygas. No, Giygas is no longer the wielder of Evil.
'He has become the embodiment of Evil itself...
'which he cannot control on his own.
'He is the Evil Power.


(Pokey)
'I understand you guys are already claiming to be heroes.
'Well, it is a gazillion years too early for you to oppose Giygas!
'You must feel pretty stupid to keep fighting without even knowing
'what Giygas looks like!
'If you were to ever see Giygas, you'd be so petrified with fear,
'you'd never be able to run away!
'...That's how scary it is!
'So, do you want me to turn off the "Devil's Machine?"
'Well, prepare to be amazed!

'So, isn't this terrifying?
'I'm terrified, too.
'Giygas cannot think rationally any more,
'and he isn't even aware of what he is doing now.
'His own mind was destroyed by his incredible power.
'What an all-mighty idiot!
'Yep, that's what he is!
'Heh heh heh heh...


(Giygas)
'...Ness...

'.....Ness...


(Pokey)
'Heh heh heh heh. You must really be at the end of your rope.
'In this bizarre dimension, you four are the only force fighting for justice...
'And here you stand,
'waiting to be burned up with all the rest of the garbage of this universe...
'Haaaaah! That's so sad. I can't help but shed a tear.
'You know, my heart is beating incredibly fast,
'...I must be experiencing absolute terror!
'Do you want to scream for help here in the dark?!
'Ha ha ha ha ha!
'Why not call your mommy, Ness!
'Say, "Mommy! Daddy! I'm so frightened! I think I'm gonna wet my pants!"
'I know you have telepahty, or something, so just try and call for help,
'you pathetically weak heroes of so-called justice!
'No one will help you now!
'Ha ha ha haah...
'Don't worry, your pitiful suffering with be over soon.


(Giygas)
'"I'm h...a...p...p...y..."


(Paula)
'"...Please give us strength,
'If it is possible... Please..."
'"Somebody...... help us."


'(All of the Mr. Saturns felt a new, startling feeling
'they had never experienced before,
'and they all started praying for the safety of Ness and his friends.)

'Giygas' defenses became unstable.


(Giygas)
'"It's not right... not... right...
'I feel g...o...o...d...."


(Paula)
'"...Please give us strength!
'Anyone who can hear our plea. Help us!"


'(Suddenly, one of the Runaway Five felt something stop him,
'and he prayed fervently for the safety of Ness and his friends.)


(Giygas)
'"I feel g...o...o...d...
'I'm h...a...p...p...y...
'...friends..."


(Paula)
'"...Please give us strength!
'Speed this prayer to all the people of earth!"


'(Paula's father thought he somehow heard his daughter's voice,
'and prayed sincerely for the safety of Paula and her friends.


(Giygas)
'Ahh, Grr, Ohhh...
'I'm h...a...p...p...y...
'Ness, Ness, Ness, Ness, Ness, Ness, Ness, Ness, Ness, Ness, Ness, Ness...


(Paula)
'"...Please give us strength!
'Anyone who can hear our plea... Help us."


'(Suddenly, Tony felt anxious about Jeff,
'and he prayed strongly for the safety of Jeff and his friends.)


(Giygas)
'"Arrgh! Yaagh!...
'It hurts, Ness...
'Arrgh! Yaagh!..."


(Paula)
'"...Please grant us power!
'Anyone who can hear our plea... Help us."


'(A young woman in Dalaam woke from a dream in which Prince Poo died,
'and she began to pray for the well-being of Poo and his friends.)


(Giygas)
'"It's not right... not right... not right...
'Ahh, Grr, Ohhh...
'Ness!"


(Paula)
'"...Please grant us strength!
'Anyone who can hear our plea... We ask for this."


'(Suddenly, Frank recalled Ness's shining young face,
'and began to pray diligently for the safety of Ness and his friends.)


(Giygas)
'"Ness!
'Ness!
'...go...b...a...c...k...."


(Paula)
'"...Please grant us power!
'Speed this prayer to all the people of the earth..."


'(Suddenly, Ness's mother felt terribly uneasy,
'and she began to pray for the safetly of her son and his friends.)


(Giygas)
'"Ness!
'Ahh, Grr, Ohhh...
'I feel g...o...o...d..."


(Paula)
'I can't think of anyone else...
'...Someone, anyone... Please help us."

'(Paula's call was absorbed by the darkness.)


(Paula)
'"Someone... can you hear me?!
'Please, give us strength!"


'Paula and her friends' calls touched the heart of (player).
'((player) prayed for the kids.)
'((player) kept praying.)
'((player) kept praying.)
'((player) kept praying.)


(Pokey)
'Ness! Now, I... well... It's going to seem like I'm running away.
'But perhaps I'll just sneak away to another era to think about my next plan.
'It's a good bet that we will see each other again...
'All right! I'll be seeing you!
'So now which one of us do you think is the cool guy?!


'The war against Giygas is over...

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+


(Poo)
'Our travels together end here.
'I must return to Dalaam, and use this experience for the good of my country.
'Ness, Paula, Jeff...
'Let me demonstrate a strange power before I go. I realized this power as a
child.
'PSI Farewell! Now!
'I'll see you again someday!


(Jeff)
'Paula, Ness...
'It was great to hang out with you guys. It really was.
'I'm glad that I had the chance to use some of the theories
'that I have been studying so hard.
'It's remarkable.
'.....
'If...
'Just maybe...
'Well, if you two get hitched someday,
'maybe I'll be the one that fixes your broken electronic appliances.
'.....
'I'm going to stay here for a while and see if I can learn more from Dr.
Andonuts.
'I mean, from my dad.
'...So it looks like this is good bye for now, my friends.


(Paula)
'Ness, will you escort me home?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "No":
'Well then, I'll escort you!


(Paula)
'Ness... Thank you for escorting me home.
'.....
'...There was something I wanted to tell you, but I've forgotten it.
'I'm sure I'll remember by the time I see you again.
'Well, I guess this is it...
'Good-bye.
'Uhhh... ...So long
'...See ya.
'...Bye.


(Mom)
'Wow, you've become such a strong, young man.
'I'd like to hear all of your stories,
'but I don't want to annoy you as soon as you walk through the door.
'After all your chats with people you met on your adventure are finally over,
'please come back here.
'The photo-man brought an album by.
'I'd like to look at it with you...


(Mom)
'Did you finish doing everything that you wanted to?
  >>Yes
  >>No

If "No":
'You'd better do everything, because once you start looking at the album,
'you can't stop!

If "Yes":
'Okay! Now you can finally share your incredible experiences with me...
'You did so well!


(Picky)
'A letter arrived from my brother, Pokey... it is addressed to Ness.
'There's no stamp, and it's not time for the mailman to come...
'Anyway, I brought it over.
'It says, "come and get me, loser!
'Spankety, spankety, spankety."
'...I wonder where he is?

Although I am not including most non-essential text in the game script, I have
set aside a section for Mr. Saturn quotes, because well, he's Mr. Saturn. The
following is a list of every Mr. Saturn quotation in the game.

21.1 Legal Stuff

This FAQ is Copyright 2005 by me. Any publishing of this FAQ without my
explicit permission will be in a world of trouble, and I will find out if that
happens. Earthbound is the Copyright product of Nintendo. I am not in anyway
affiliated with the company or its employees.

21.2 Emailing Me

I'd love to hear any commentary or questions about the Script. I can be reached
at tasteless@gmail.com

If there is something missing or wrong with the Script, please feel free to
email me the correction and I'll try to fix it. The text for the last part of
the Giygas battle is a little off because the text goes off the screen as fast
as I could type it.

Do NOT ask me where to get a copy of the ROM. These emails will go straight 
into the trash.
